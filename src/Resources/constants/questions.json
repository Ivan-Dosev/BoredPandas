We concede that the next generation of business ideas should not be controlled by centralised coorporations, but from the individuals who are using them. As a result of that we created a fully decentralised NFT collection to back up the development of our Web3 platform. Our primary focus is to become a market leader in the adventure travel sector, but the ultimate goal is to establish the largest decentralised travel service provider."

Therefore all other interested visitors should borrow a Bored Panda for the time period while the event is taking place. This provides a unique opportunity for the early adopters of our collection, because they will be able to lend or sell their panda at a higher price once the platform goes live."

A healthy and robust platform will attract more usage, and increase the value of the NFT collection."
